# All Portal

A simple portal for posting and applying made possible by django. Supports all databases supported by django. 
Currently uses - 
1. postgress in deployment (```manage.py```)
2. sqlite in development (```local.py```)

## Use Cases 

<p>
Can be easily modified to be used in any place where one user group posts a project or job and another user group applies to it. 
</p>

<u>Common use cases - </u>
- College's **Research portal** where teacher can post a project and student can apply
- **Jobs Portal** - Companies posts jobs and user applies 
- **e-commerce app** - Vendors Posts about items and prices and customer buys them ( in that case a payment gateway needs to be integrated )

> ### Note Important
> I created ```local.py``` to mirror django's ```manage.py``` and use it for development to know more about it see my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68766668/django-best-practice-for-running-switching-dev-debug-product-mode/68766902#68766902"> stack overflow answer. </a>
> I know it creates some duplicate code and can be a bad practise, but since it simplifies things i go with it XD.
> Furthermore, currently I make a third file where I store the common code and inhereit from there, I will update this repo as well wherever I get time.
